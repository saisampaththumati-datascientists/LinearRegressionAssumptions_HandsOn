# LinearRegressionAssumptions_HandsOn



***We will construct a linear model that can predict a car's mileage (mpg) by using its other attributes.***
## Data Description:
- The dataset has 9 variables, including the name of the car and its various attributes like horsepower, weight, region of origin, etc. Missing values in the data are marked by a series of question marks.

- A detailed description of the variables is given below.

- mpg: miles per gallon
- cylinders: number of cylinders
- displacement: engine displacement in cubic inches
- horsepower: horsepower of the car
- weight: weight of the car in pounds
- acceleration: time taken, in seconds, to accelerate from O to 60 mph
- model year: year of manufacture of the car (modulo 100)
- origin: region of origin of the car (1 - American, 2 - European, 3 - Asian)
- car name: name of the car
